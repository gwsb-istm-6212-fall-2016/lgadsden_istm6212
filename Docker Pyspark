1. Install Docker Toolbox for Windows. https://github.com/docker/toolbox/releases/tag/v1.12.3 (if you have Windows 10 Education or Pro you can just install docker for windows here 
https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-windows/

2. Click on Docker Quickstart Terminal (allow it to set the settings)

3. try to run "Docker run hello-world"

4. if it works run this command  "docker run -d -p 8888:8888 jupyter/pyspark-notebook"

5. also run "docker ps"  --- if you see 'jupyter/pyspark-notebook' under image then it is running

6. run "docker-machine ip" ... make not of the ip address

7. from any broswer type the ip address then :8888 ---- for example 127.0.0.4:8888

8. if it connects you now have pyspark! 

9. open a new python 3 notebook and write try this 

import pyspark
sc = pyspark.SparkContext('local[*]')

# do something to prove it works
rdd = sc.parallelize(range(1000))
rdd.takeSample(False, 5)
If it works you are set!

10. To quit press Ctrl-C twice 

11. Then press press docker stop "name" --- i.e. docker stop symbarian_princess
a. you find the name when you run 'docker ps'

12. When you want to start it again type 'docker start -i [name]' 

You may want to go over the docker gettign started docs --- it should take 20 mins.

Try it out! It will be a big help in the future.
